<P STYLE="COLOR:PURPLE; FONT-FAMILY:ARIAL; FONT-SIZE:90%; TEXT-ALIGN:JUSTIFY;"> <Q> Why worry too much about what is not in our power to control?</Q>
This and many more questions H<SUB>2</SUB> I keep asking myself.10<sup>2</sup> A times,<EM> <INS> I feel in charge and full of possessive power to transform things around me. </INS> </EM>
Next moment, <STRONG>I am vulnerable and seek &copy; confidence in my hope</STRONG>.  <I> <b>My faith is what keeps me going.</b> </I> So many times, I will fall to the ground, my whole world will crumble before my very eyes, but we are a people safeguarded by our quest and wish for a better life.
Should &#169; &#170 I then allow a little bump on the way deter my voyage in search of a greener pasture?
<SMALL>Should I allow a fall stop my &reg; moving train of hopes?</SMALL>
<MARK> <DEL>Well it is obviously clear that we live in a society where only those that dare to dream stand a chance of living.</MARK></DEL> <BR>
